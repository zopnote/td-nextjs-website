TD (td-nextjs-website)

Website for a small commercial side-business.
Built with Next.js and TypeScript,
this repository hosts the source for https://www.tdls-del.de.

This repository contains the Next.js + TypeScript website
for a small commercial side-business (tdls-del).
The site aims to be fast, SEO-friendly, and easy to maintain.
It includes the basic pages and features required for a small business
presence: home, services, contact, and simple CMS/content management
patterns where needed.

The website was done quite quickly, so I want to drastically improve the source code
structure and occurrence of inline CSS. In the future I'll extract the CSS in
stylesheets and the text in YAML-files to ensure the long-term maintainability.
